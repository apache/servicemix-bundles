    The Java client for Elasticsearch provides strongly typed requests and responses for all Elasticsearch
    APIs. It delegates protocol handling to an http client such as the Elasticsearch Low Level REST client
    that takes care of all transport-level concerns (http connection establishment and pooling, retries,
    etc).
