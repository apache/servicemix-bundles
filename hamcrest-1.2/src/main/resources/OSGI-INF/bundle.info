\u001B[1mDESCRIPTION\u001B[0m
    Hamcrest provides a library of matcher objects (also known as constraints or
    predicates) allowing 'match' rules to be defined declaratively, to be
    used in other frameworks. Typical scenarios include testing frameworks,
    mocking libraries and UI validation rules.

    Hamcrest has been ported to Java, C++, Objective-C, Python, PHP and Erlang.

    Note: Hamcrest it is not a testing library: it just happens that matchers are
    very useful for testing.
