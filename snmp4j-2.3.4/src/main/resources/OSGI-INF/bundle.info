    SNMP4J is an enterprise class free open source and state-of-the-art SNMP implementation for Java 2SE 1.4 or later.
    SNMP4J supports command generation (managers) as well as command responding (agents). Its clean object oriented
    design is inspired by SNMP++, which is a well-known SNMPv1/v2c/v3 API for C++ (see http://www.agentpp.com).

    The SNMP4J Java SNMP API provides the following features:

        * SNMPv3 with MD5 and SHA authentication and DES and AES 128, AES 192, and AES 256 privacy.
        * Pluggable Message Processing Models with implementations for MPv1, MPv2c, and MPv3
        * All PDU types.
        * Pluggable transport mappings. UDP and TCP are supported out-of-the-box.
        * Pluggable timeout model.
        * Synchronous and asynchronous requests.
        * Command generator as well as command responder support.
        * Free open source with the Apache license model
        * Javaâ„¢ 1.4.1 or later
        * Logging based on Log4J
        * Row-based efficient asynchronous table retrieval with GETBULK.
        * Multi-threading support.
