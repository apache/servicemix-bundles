\u001B[1mDESCRIPTION\u001B[0m
    RELAX (REgular LAnguage description for XML) is a specification for describing XML-based languages.
    XHTML 1.0, for example, can be described in RELAX.

    A description written in RELAX is called a RELAX grammar. An XML document can be verified against a RELAX grammar.

    Compared with DTD(Document Type Definition), RELAX has new features:

        * RELAX grammars are represented in the XML instance syntax
        * RELAX borrows rich datatypes of XML Schema Part 2
        * RELAX is namespace-aware

    The ISO RELAX project is started to host the public interfaces useful for applications to support RELAX Core.
    But nowadays some of the stuff we have is schema language neutral. All the source code and binaries are available
    under the MIT license (see inside the distribution jar file for details.)
