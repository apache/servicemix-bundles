\u001B[1mDESCRIPTION\u001B[0m
    HAPI (HL7 application programming interface; pronounced "happy") is an
    open-source, object-oriented HL7 2.x parser for Java. HL7
    is a messaging specification for healthcare information systems. This project
    is not affiliated with the HL7 organization; we are just writing some software
    that conforms to their specification. The project was initiated by University
    Health Network (a large multi-site teaching hospital in Toronto, Canada).
