\u001B[1mDESCRIPTION\u001B[0m
    OSWorkflow is fairly different from most other workflow systems available, both commercially and in the open source
    world. What makes OSWorkflow different is that it is extremely flexible. This can be hard to grasp at first, however.
    For example, OSWorkflow does not mandate a graphical tool for developing workflows, and the recommended approach is
    to write the xml workflow descriptors 'by hand'. It is up to the application developer to provide this sort of
    integration, as well as any integration with existing code and databases. These may seem like problems to someone
    who is looking for a quick "plug-and-play" workflow solution, but we've found that such a solution never provides
    enough flexibility to properly fulfill all requirements in a full-blown application.

    OSWorkflow can be considered a "low level" workflow implementation. Situations like "loops" and "conditions" that
    might be represented by a graphical icon in other workflow systems must be "coded" in OSWorkflow. That's not to say
    that actual code is needed to implement situations like this, but a scripting language must be employed to specify
    these conditions. It is not expected that a non-technical user modify workflow. We've found that although some
    systems provide GUIs that allow for simple editing of workflows, the applications surrounding the workflow usually end
    up damaged when changes like these are made. We believe it is best for these changes to be made by a developer who
    is aware of each change. Having said that, the latest version provides a GUI designer that can help with the editing
    of the workflow.
