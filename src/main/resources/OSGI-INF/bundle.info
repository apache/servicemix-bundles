\u001B[1mDESCRIPTION\u001B[0m
    iBatis data mapper framework makes it easier to use a relational database with object-oriented applications.
    iBatis couples objects with stored procedures or SQL statements using a XML descriptor. Simplicity is the biggest
    advantage of the iBatis data mapper over object relational mapping tools.

    To use the iBatis data mapper, you rely on your own objects, XML, and SQL. There is little to learn that you
    don't already know. With the iBatis Data Mapper, you have the full power of both SQL and stored procedures at
    your fingertips.
