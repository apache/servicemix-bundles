\u001B[1mDESCRIPTION\u001B[0m
    The Java API for XML Processing (JAXP) enables applications to parse, transform, validate and query XML documents
    using an API that is independent of a particular XML processor implementation. JAXP provides a pluggability layer
    to enable vendors to provide their own implementations without introducing dependencies in application code.
    Using this software, application and tool developers can build fully-functional XML-enabled Java applications for
    e-commerce, application integration, and web publishing.

    JAXP is a standard component in the Java platform. An implementation of the JAXP 1.3 is included in J2SE 5.0 and
    an implementation of JAXP 1.4 is in Java SE 6.0 and OpenJDK7. JAXP 1.4 is a maintenance release of JAXP 1.3 with
    support for the Streaming API for XML (StAX).
