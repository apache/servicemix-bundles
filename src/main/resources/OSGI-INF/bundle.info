\u001B[1mDESCRIPTION\u001B[0m
    Since early 2006, Amazon Web Services (AWS) has provided companies of all sizes with an infrastructure web
    services platform in the cloud. With AWS you can requisition compute power, storage, and other
    services–gaining access to a suite of elastic IT infrastructure services as your business demands them.
    With AWS you have the flexibility to choose whichever development platform or programming model makes the
    most sense for the problems you’re trying to solve. You pay only for what you use, with no up-front expenses
    or long-term commitments, making AWS the most cost-effective way to deliver your application to your
    customers and clients. And, with AWS, you can take advantage of Amazon.com’s global computing infrastructure
    that is the backbone of Amazon.com’s multi-billion retail business and transactional enterprise whose
    scalable, reliable, and secure distributed computing infrastructure has been honed for over a decade.

    Using Amazon Web Services, an e-commerce web site can weather unforeseen demand with ease; a pharmaceutical
    company can “rent” computing power to execute large-scale simulations; a media company can serve unlimited
    videos, music, and more; and an enterprise can deploy bandwidth-consuming services and training to its
    mobile workforce.
