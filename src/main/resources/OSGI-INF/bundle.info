\u001B[1mDESCRIPTION\u001B[0m
    Tomcat 6.0 uses the Jasper 2 JSP Engine to implement the JavaServer Pages 2.0
    specification.

    Jasper 2 has been redesigned to significantly improve performance over the
    original Jasper. In addition to general code improvements the following
    changes were made:

        * JSP Custom Tag Pooling - The java objects instantiated for JSP Custom
          Tags can now be pooled and reused. This significantly boosts the
          performance of JSP pages which use custom tags.
        * Background JSP compilation - If you make a change to a JSP page which
          had already been compiled Jasper 2 can recompile that page in the
          background. The previously compiled JSP page will still be available to
          serve requests. Once the new page has been compiled successfully it will
          replace the old page. This helps improve availability of your JSP pages
          on a production server.
        * Recompile JSP when included page changes - Jasper 2 can now detect when
          a page included at compile time from a JSP has changed and then
          recompile the parent JSP.
        * JDT used to compile JSP pages - The Eclipse JDT Java compiler is now
          used to perform JSP java source code compilation. This compiler loads
          source dependencies from the container classloader. Ant and javac can
          still be used.

    Jasper is implemented using the servlet class
    org.apache.jasper.servlet.JspServlet.
