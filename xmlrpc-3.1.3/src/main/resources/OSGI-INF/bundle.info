    Apache XML-RPC is a Java implementation of XML-RPC, a popular protocol that uses XML over HTTP
    to implement remote procedure calls.

    Version 3 of Apache XML-RPC is still compliant to the XML-RPC specification. However, the user
    may enable several vendor extensions are available, that greatly extend the power of XML-RPC:

    * All primitive Java types are supported, including long, byte, short, and double.
    * Calendar objects are supported. In particular, timezone settings, and milliseconds may be sent.
    * DOM nodes, or JAXB objects, can be transmitted. So are objects implementing the java.io.Serializable interface.
    * Both server and client can operate in a streaming mode, which preserves resources much better than the default mode, which is based on large internal byte arrays.
